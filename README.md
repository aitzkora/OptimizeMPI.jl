# OptimizeMPI.jl

This repository contains source code for the following poster at Julia Con 2020 : 
"Calling a parallel simulation code from Julia". The aim is to demonstrating to call
a distributed memory parallel program from julia for doing parameter optimization. I want
to share my small expertiences about that

# Directories
- `squared_norm` : a very basic example using the squared Lâ‚‚ norm
- `heat` : control problem on the 2D heat equation using finite differencies

# Requirements 

- CMake 
- MPI library
- a Fortran 2003 Compiler (tested against Gfortran 10.1.0)

# Compilation
- go into `<directory>` (`heat` or `squared_norm`)
```bash
cd heat
```
- If your CMake is recent enough run the following
```bash
cmake -B build && for i in test, install; do make -j 4 -C build $i ; done
```
It must install a *shared library* in the current directory (.so, .dylib or .dll)
Note : If your cmake does not suport -B, you could use the legacy way

```bash
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make && make test && make install && cd ..
```

# Running examples

```bash
mpirun -np 9 julia scr_optim.jl
```

*todo*: add the poster and documentation using a ipython notebook
