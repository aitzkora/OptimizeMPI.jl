    "## Rationale\n",
    " \n",
    "Imagine you are a Ph.D student and use every a parallel software for simulating some physical process \n",
    "relative to your research work; For some reason, you need to optimize some \n",
    "physical parameters : In other words, you have to solve an *inverse problem*, whereas \n",
    "running your simulation is generally called *direct problem*. \n",
    "Good optimization methods are numerous, but implementing state-of-the-art methods in a low-level \n",
    "language such as Fortran, C or C++ is not straightforward. In this poster, we want to present \n",
    "some recipes (technical and numerical), to do that with \"Julia\". The knowledge level remains basic\n",
    "in a perspective to be used as a tutorial . Our hypotheses are the following : \n",
    "\n",
    " - distributed memory paradigm for parallelism (i.e. MPI) \n",
    " - direct problem is Fortran or C.\n",
    " - For optimization methods needing a gradient, implementing gradient computation method will be\n",
    " done in the low level language.\n",

    "## technical tools\n",
    "\n",
    "To manage to implement our optimization process, we need mainly of two ingredients\n",
    "1. calling a piece of external code \n",
    "2. running julia scripts in a MPI environment \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go : \n",
    "\n",
    "### calling Fortran or C code\n",
    "\n",
    "- to call a external piece of code,  we will use the *Julia* statement `ccall`. As documented\n",
    "[here](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/c/) or [there](https://craftofcoding.wordpress.com/2017/02/08/calling-c-from-julia-i-simple-arrays/), the syntax is the following\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "ccall((:funcName, library), returnType, (argType1, argType2, ...), (argVal1, argVal2, ...))\n",
    "ccall(funcPtr, returnType, (argType1, argType2, ...), (argVal1, argVal2, ...))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `function_name` is the mangled name of the C function in the shared library library. If you do not know\n",
    "what is mangling, take a look at [there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling) : Roughly languages like \n",
    "Fortran (due to its case insensitivity) or C++ (in which the same function name could have several \n",
    "different signatures), must encode their function names when they interoperate with C.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Remarks \n",
    "- `library` is only _formally_ a string :\n",
    "- you could use `\"./mylib.so\"`   \n",
    "- but ⚠ you **could not** use `string(pwd(),\"/mylib.so\")` ⚠ \n",
    "- to use a library which is not in `.`, add the path to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` before launching \n",
    "**Julia** (Just tested on Linux, adapt the rule for MacOS with `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`)\n",
    "- using `dlopen` and `dlsym` one could directly use the function pointer call\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we could do a small C example, with a function adding 2 to its argument"
